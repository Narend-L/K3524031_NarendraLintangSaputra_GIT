    <h2>PTIK FKIP UNS</h2>

    <p>
        The Faculty of Teacher Training and Education, <span class="highlight-target">Sebelas Maret University</span>,
        Surakarta is an <span class="highlight-target">Educational Personnel Education Institution (LPTK)</span> 
        which has 24 study programs in 6 majors. Each study program has its own characteristics in producing 
        <span class="highlight-target">superior, strong and intelligent educational staff.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
        The <span class="highlight-target">Informatics and Computer Technology Education (PTIK)</span> 
        study program is planned to take shelter in the management of the <span class="highlight-target">Engineering 
        and Vocational Education (PTK)</span> department. This placement revises our previous statement,
        where the PTIK study program is under the P.MIPA department. PTIK is a study program that will 
        produce graduates who are <span class="highlight-target">prioritized to teach in vocational/vocational 
        programs.</span> So, it would be better if PTIK was under the PTK department which oversees vocational
        programs such as <span class="highlight-target">Building Engineering Education, and Mechanical 
        Engineering Education.</span> To meet the needs of lecturers in the field of information technology
        that cannot be met by the PTK department, PTIK will conduct <span class="highlight-target">resource sharing
        with the mathematics study program.</span>
    </p>
